## Overview

Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in [Go][].
It is optimized for speed, ease of use, and configurability.
Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website.

Hugo relies on Markdown files with front matter for metadata, and you can run Hugo from any directory.
This works well for shared hosts and other systems where you donâ€™t have a privileged account.

Hugo renders a typical website of moderate size in a fraction of a second.
A good rule of thumb is that each piece of content renders in around 1 millisecond.

Hugo is designed to work well for any kind of website including blogs, tumbles, and docs.

#### Supported Architectures

Currently, we provide pre-built Hugo binaries for Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, OpenBSD, macOS (Darwin), and [Android](https://gist.github.com/bep/a0d8a26cf6b4f8bc992729b8e50b480b) for x64, i386 and ARM architectures.

Hugo may also be compiled from source wherever the Go compiler tool chain can run, e.g. for other operating systems including Plan 9 and Solaris.

**Complete documentation is available at [Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/).**

## Choose How to Install

If you want to use Hugo as your site generator, simply install the Hugo binaries.
The Hugo binaries have no external dependencies.

To contribute to the Hugo source code or documentation, you should [fork the Hugo GitHub project](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo#fork-destination-box) and clone it to your local machine.

Finally, you can install the Hugo source code with `go`, build the binaries yourself, and run Hugo that way.
Building the binaries is an easy task for an experienced `go` getter.

### Install Hugo as Your Site Generator (Binary Install)

Use the [installation instructions in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

### Build and Install the Binaries from Source (Advanced Install)

#### Prerequisite Tools

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Go (we test it with the last 2 major versions; but note that Hugo 0.95.0 only builds with >= Go 1.18.)](https://golang.org/dl/)

#### Fetch from GitHub

To fetch and build the source from GitHub:

```bash
mkdir $HOME/src
cd $HOME/src
git clone https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo.git
cd hugo
go install
```

**If you are a Windows user, substitute the `$HOME` environment variable above with `%USERPROFILE%`.**

If you want to compile with Sass/SCSS support use `--tags extended` and make sure `CGO_ENABLED=1` is set in your go environment. If you don't want to have CGO enabled, you may use the following command to temporarily enable CGO only for hugo compilation:

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=1 go install --tags extended
```

## The Hugo Documentation

The Hugo documentation now lives in its own repository, see https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs. But we do keep a version of that documentation as a `git subtree` in this repository. To build the sub folder `/docs` as a Hugo site, you need to clone this repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gohugoio/hugo.git
```
