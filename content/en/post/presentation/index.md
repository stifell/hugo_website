## Important rules when creating a presentation

### Rule 1 — the text must be read

The concept of readability in simple language means that the text can be easy to read. For example, if you put white text on a black background, then the item with readability will be 100% completed.

If the purple text is written on a red background, then it will be difficult for the eye of an ordinary viewer to concentrate on information with such an abundance of color and brightness.

### Rule 2 — Colors

Before starting to create a presentation, it is always good to work out its color content, choose a certain palette of colors from two or three main shades and build the entire base around them. In Powerpoint or Keynote, it is convenient to save this palette immediately so that you can see all the working colors in front of your eyes. When filling a presentation, it is better not to use more than two or three colors on the slide, otherwise the viewer's attention may dissipate due to the abundance of shades. It is important to attach special importance to each color, for example, to make all headings yellow, and the entire main text white or black. If we reinforce the information with color, it will be easier for the reader to analyze the slide, and he will be able to quickly find the necessary information.

In the slide below, we give the title and numbering an orange color, thereby directing the viewer from the anchors of our slide to the main black text. The black color on the slide is the most, respectively, the reader concludes that this is the bulk of the basic information.

### Rule 3 — Text and its style

The font format when writing headers, body text and footers affects how information will be perceived. Most often, the serif style is used for headings, that is, with pointed corners. For the main text, a sans-serif font is more suitable, that is, with right angles and smooth lines.

The text itself will give us a hint on the font style, using the example of a baby and a mother, it is more logical to work with sans-serif text so that it does not overload the airy pleasant slide once again.

### Rule 4 — Picture as HQ

When opening each new slide, the user looks for a visual, graphic or illustration with his eyes, those objects that will help him relax while reading a large volume of text or reinforce the information he has read.

When creating graphic forms and objects from scratch, there are no difficulties with their quality and reproduction on the slide, and if you save images from Internet sources and insert them on the slide, the quality may be poor. Why is this happening?

Most often, when searching for images, we do not pay attention to how they look in full-screen mode. We see them in a small format and they often look good. However, displaying a slide in full-screen mode to an audience or broadcasting it on a large computer screen can emphasize a poor-quality image. It is important to have access to the HQ picture so that the viewer does not have a feeling of not professionally prepared presentation.

### Rule 5 — Don't overload the slide

At school we often made presentations and most of them structurally and compositionally looked like this.

Unfortunately, such slides absolutely do not breathe, do not have free space, that is, air. And air is the most important thing on the slide, without it, the layout is drowning in text and visual information. The designer's task is to arrange the objects on the slide in such a way that they coexist, and not displace each other. In white space (in the air) there's nothing wrong. On the contrary, the more of it, the simpler and more minimalistic the slide looks, and therefore clearer for the reader.

The meaning of any design is to convey information in a clear and understandable form, the logical arrangement of elements on the slide, the creation of a neat and clear structure. And last of all, this is style, beauty and visual design.
