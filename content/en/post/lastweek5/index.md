## How I spent the last week

1. The beginning of the week turned out to be easy, so on Monday I went in for sports and read a book.

2. Tuesday and Wednesday were generally no different, except that I started doing labs on operating systems.

3. Friday is a hard day. I spent the first two classes at the computer, learning C++. From 15:00 to 19:20 I studied English.

4. On Saturday from 12:00 to 14:50 there were couples for computer practice. We have done lab work on Arduino.

5. On Sunday, I completely rested mentally and physically.
