How I spent last week:

1. The days from Monday to Thursday were easy, as there were few pairs, but there were a lot of laboratory tests on the OS, so I started doing, I didn't get lazy.

2. On Friday, I spent the first two pairs at the computer, learning C++. From 15:00 to 19:20 I studied English.

3. I went to IT classes on Saturday, did lab tests on Arduino. After that, I went to a running competition between Moscow universities.

4. On Sunday I completely rested mentally and physically.
