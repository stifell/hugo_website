## Article

How I spent last week:

1. The beginning of the week turned out to be easy, so on Monday I played sports and read a book.

2. Tuesday and Wednesday were no different in general, except that I started doing laboratory work on operating systems.

3. On Thursday I went to university for the first two pairs. Asked interesting questions about the laboratory.

4. Friday is a hard day. I spent the first two pairs at the computer, studying C++. According to the plan, there should be English from 15:00 to 19:20, but there was only an online event.

5. On Saturday, from 12:00 to 14:50, there were couples on a computer workshop. We did laboratory work on Arduino.

6. On Sunday, completely mentally and physically rested.
