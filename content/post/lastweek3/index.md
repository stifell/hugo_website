## Article

How I spent last week:

1. The days from Monday to Thursday were easy, as there were not many couples.

2. On Friday, I spent the first two pairs at the computer, learning C++. From 15:00 to 19:20 I studied English.

3. I didn't go to couples on Saturday. There were running competitions at the RUDN Stadium. I took 2nd place, congratulate me.

4. On Sunday I completely rested mentally and physically.
