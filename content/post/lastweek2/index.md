## Article

How I spent last week:

1. I went home from Monday to Wednesday, as there were holidays.

2. On Friday, I spent the first two pairs at the computer, studying C++. From 15:00 to 19:20 I studied English

3. On Saturday, from 12:00 to 14:50, there were couples at a computer seminar. We have done laboratory work on Arduino.

4. On Sunday I had a full rest mentally and physically
